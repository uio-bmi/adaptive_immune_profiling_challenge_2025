## Description of problem

Imagine your body's immune system as a vast, personal army, constantly on guard against invaders like viruses and bacteria. Each soldier in this army is an "immune receptor," a tiny protein designed to recognize and fight off threats. What is truly incredible is the sheer variety of these soldiers: you have billions of unique immune receptors, each one a potential weapon against a new disease!

When a new enemy (what researchers call an "antigen," like a specific virus variant) attacks, only a tiny handful of these billions of immune receptors are the perfect match to bind to it and neutralize the threat. It is like finding a needle in a haystack, but your body does it all the time.

Now, here is the exciting challenge: What if we could peek into this personal army of immune receptors from many different people? We will have collections of their unique immune receptors (called "repertoires"), and we will also know if those individuals have a certain immune state (e.g. diseased or healthy).

The **big questions** for this competition:

- Can we predict a person's disease just by looking at their immune receptor "fingerprint"? Without knowing which receptors fight which diseases, can your machine learning models learn to identify patterns in these immune receptor collections that tell us if someone is sick or healthy?
- Can we identify the "contributing" immune receptors? If our models can predict disease, can they also tell us which specific immune receptors are most strongly linked to a particular disease? This would be like finding the star soldiers in the immune army!

Solving these problems is a huge step forward for medicine. It could lead to new ways to diagnose diseases earlier and even develop targeted treatments based on our own immune system's unique capabilities.

## Evaluation

There will be a total of eight training datasets and ten test datasets included in this competition. For each `repertoire_id` across all test datasets, the participants has to return a probability for the repertoire being label-positive. In addition, a ranked list of the top 50,000 unique rows (including junction_aa, v_call, and j_call) that best contribute to the optimal classification for each training dataset has to be returned, regardless of the data encoding used. Note that these label-associated sequences have to be sorted based on some form of importance scores from most important to less important; we may use only top-n sequences from the ordered list of 50k sequences for evaluation. These will be used to compute the performance metrics [**area under the ROC curve**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) and [**Jaccard similarity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), respectively, for each of the datasets. A **weighted average** of both measures across all the included datasets will be used as the basis for ranking on the leaderboard for the competition.
