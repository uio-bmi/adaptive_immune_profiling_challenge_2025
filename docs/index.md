# AIRR-ML-25: Adaptive Immune Profiling Challenge

## Overview

In this competition, youâ€™ll develop machine learning models to simultaneously perform two tasks: **(a)** predict the immune state (e.g. disease, healthy) of individuals based on so-called adaptive immune repertoires (sets of protein sequences), and **(b)** identify immune state-associated receptor sequences (those that explain immune state in the first task). The goal is to expedite ML-based solutions for immunodiagnostics and therapeutics discovery.
